# Protein3D_QG

## 1. Protein structure prediction for 26 diverse maize inbred lines

We predicted protein 3D structure for 26 maize NAM founder lines using AlphaFold v2 with "reduced_dbs" parameter.

RSA was computed using DSSP and last setp predicted strucutre as input file.


## 2. Population genetics in 282 population

We lift over 282 assocation panel and annotate it using structure feature and other population parameters (GERP...).

## 3. PWAS (proteome-wide association) in NAM population

We compared sequence and structure similarity matirx computed by MAFFT, Muscle, T-coffee, US-align.


## 4. PWP (proteome-wide prediction) in NAM population 

We compared sequence and structure similarity matirx computed by MAFFT, Muscle, T-coffee, US-align.

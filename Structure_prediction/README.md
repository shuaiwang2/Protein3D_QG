The predicted protein structures were performed using AlphaFold v2.0.0 with parameter preset as reduced_dbs as described in the AlphaFold database publication22 on the Frontera supercomputer. All B73 v5 protein sequences and other NAM founder lines canonical protein sequences were selected as input. Sequences with residue codes ‘*’ (premature stop codon) or ‘X’ (unknown residue) are also excluded. The identical protein sequence was merely predicted once to reduce resource consumption. All B73 protein sequences were predicted, and canonical protein sequences from other NAM founder lines were extracted for 3D structure folding. We optimized the AlphaFold2 pipeline to increase its computational efficiency on this large-scale cluster. This optimization does not generate any different folding.
